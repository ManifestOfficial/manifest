# CASE Contribution

Thank you very much for contributing to [CASE](https://case.app/) and Happy Hacktoberfest ! 🎉 🧙‍♂️

[CASE](https://case.app/) is an Open-Source CRUD app generator that helps developers to build CRUD web applications in 15 minutes by focusing only on the data.

[CASE](https://case.app/) is made with love, lo-fi and headaches using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) & [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).

### Pre-requisites

[CASE](https://case.app/) is made with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js), the angular/cli is a pre-requisite.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

[CASE](https://case.app/) uses the concepts like entities, relations and repositories from [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm). You can have a better understanding of these concepts by checking [their docs here](https://typeorm.io/).

Also, [CASE](https://case.app/) uses the concepts of guards, module and controller from [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest). You can have a better understanding of these concepts by checking [their docs here](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

**_You don't need to be an expert in the above mentioned dependencies to contribute - your great ideas, logic, good will & common sense are always welcome to the project ! 🧠🌈_**

### Code contributions

If you are looking for an easy way to help, you can start with the issues labelled [good first issue](https://github.com/casejs/CASE/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [documentation](https://github.com/casejs/CASE/labels/documentation) ! 💪

##### Serve CASE in Contribution mode

Open a terminal and run the following:

```bash
# From root of the repo.
cd packages/case/client
npm install
ng serve --configuration=contribution
```

The client will be running on http://localhost:4200 ! 🌸

Open a second terminal simultaneously :

```bash
# From root of the repo.
cd packages/case/server
npm install
npm run start:dev

# You have to generate users credentials by seeding data to be able to auth with.
# Seed in dev mode.
npm run seed:dev
```

The server is now running on contributor mode ! 🌼

⚠️ You may need to restart your server from time to time to see the modifications you bring to the client.

> 💡 To simulate the `app` root folder of a new CASE repo, you can use the folder `packages/case/server/src/_contribution-root`.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain our quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible version of [CASE](https://case.app/)
- Enable a sustainable system for our maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by our maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing ?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

> 🧙‍♂️ During Hacktoberfest, don't forget to add `hacktoberfest` label to your PR. If it's accepted, we will merge it with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.
> If we judge it is not acceptable, we will not hesitate to label your PR as `spammy` which can make you disqualified in Hacktoberfest. 😱
